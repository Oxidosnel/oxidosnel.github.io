=============================
A Second Level Header
---- 

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.
### Header 3

 Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.


* Candy.
* Gum.
* Booze.

+ Candy1.
+ Gum2.
+ Booze3.

- Candy4.

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`

	you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:
	
	<blockquote>
	<p>For example.</p>
	</blockquote>

	2.  bupkis
		* BELITTLER
	3. burper
*   Cunning

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

\~\~Strikethrough\~\~

\`\`\`
Fenced code blocks are like Stardard
Markdown’s regular code blocks, except that
they’re not indented and instead rely on a
start and end fence lines to delimit the code
block.

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |

Left         | Center        | Right
